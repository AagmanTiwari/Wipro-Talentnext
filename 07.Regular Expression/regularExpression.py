# 03. Split the following irregular sentence into proper words.
# Given sentence: sentence = "A, very   very; irregular_sentence"
# Expected output: A very very irregular sentence

# 05. Extract all the text portions between the tags from the following HTML page:

# URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/selva86/datasets/master/sample.html

# Goal: Get visible content inside HTML tags such as headings and paragraphs.

# Sample desired output:
# ['Your Title Here', 'Link Name', 'This is a Header', 'This is a Medium Header', 
#  'This is a new paragraph! ', 'This is a another paragraph!', 
#  'This is a new sentence without a paragraph break, in bold italics.']
